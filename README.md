Background loading of images in iOS using NSOperationQueue.

This project is a simple demo project, that loads 200 images in the background using NSOperationQueue, limiting the operation queue to 20 at a time.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point. You may wish to combine some of the classes to optimize the code, and of course expand on the image loading algorithm, which is very rudimentary.
